> **Summary**
- This pack is a small fix for Wynn pack when using [VulkanMod](https://modrinth.com/mod/vulkanmod)
#


> **Note**

- This pack is only for Vulkan, you should only download/include it for your modpack if it is a Vulkan modpack
- Make sure to place it on top of the server pack for it to work (require [Server Pack Unlocker](https://modrinth.com/mod/server-pack-unlocker) or [Serverpack Priority](https://modrinth.com/mod/serverpack-priority))
- Recommended modpack: [https://modrinth.com/modpack/vulkan-my-mc](https://modrinth.com/modpack/vulkan-my-mc). You can use [Wynnmod](https://modrinth.com/mod/wynnmod) instead of Wynntils for extra features.
